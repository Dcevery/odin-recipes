  <h2>Recipe one: Tortillas</h2>
  <img src=img/Tortilla.jpeg>
  <p><a href=https://thecafesucrefarine.com/best-ever-homemade-flour-tortillas/> 
      This</a> recipe is abosulety the best thing i've ever had. Well, maybe....
      To be honest, I've never made this recipe but look at that picture.
      <em>It looks like the world best flour tortilla.</em>
      Therefore, we must make this recipe in order to make the following recipe.
      With that said, we will begin with listing the ingredients and than the insructions.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>3 cups flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/3 cup of a neutral floweverd oil (extra virgin olive oil, vegetable oil, ect)</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So, now for the instructions...</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Combine the dry ingredients and mix together</li>
      <li>add the wet ingredients into the center of the mix and begin mixing
          until the ingredients are incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>Put the dough on a floured surface and knead until it is smooth</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into 16 pieces and flatten each piece with palm of your hand</li>
      <li>Cover and rest for 15 minutes.</li>
      <Li>After the rest, roll out each piece and cook over medium heat. <em>Don't stack
           uncooked tortillas because they will stick! </em></Li>
  </ol>

  <p> <a href=https://dadwithapan.com/smoked-carnitas-on-a-pellet-grill/ >
      This recipe</a> is <strong>VERY GOOD</strong> and I know this as a fact
      beacuse I have actually made it unlike the tortillas. I was dissapointed with
      all of the other carintas recipes I've tried until I found this one. So, let's
      started! Like the totillas, we will go over the ingredients and than the instructions.
  </p>
  <p> For the pork shoulder. Quick note, you can use whatever dry rub you want but this is 
      what I used.
      <ul>
          <li>3 lb pork shoulder</li>
          <li>2 tbsp of salt</li>
          <li>2 tbsp course ground pepper</li>
          <li>2 tbsp of paprika</li>
          <li>2 tbsp yellow mustard</li>
          <li>1 tbsp chili powder</li>
          <li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
          
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Next we have the ingredients for the braising liquid.
      <ul>
          <li>3-4 dried guaillo peppers</li>
          <li>2 oranges</li>
          <li>1 red onion, roughly chopped</li>
          <li>4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
          <li>2 bay leaves</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>2 cups water</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>So, now for the instructions.
      <ol>
          <li>Preheat your grill! Start the pellet grill and set it to 225 F</li>
          <li>Cover the pork shoulder with a think layer of mustard and than liberally coat
              it with the dry rub.</li>
          <li>Place the pork shoulder in the grill for 4 hours</li>
          <li>After 4 hours, cut the pork shoulder into 2 inch cubes and place into dutch oven</li>
          <li>Squeeze the juice from the oranges and place them inside along with the other ingredients
              from the braising liquid </li>
          <li>Increase temperature of the pellet grill to 350 F and place the covered dutch oven
              into the grill </li>
          <li>Cook for 3 hours</li>
          <li>After 3 hours, remove the pork from the oven and crank the heat up again</li>
          <li>Let it heat up for 10-15 minutes</li>
          <li>Place the pork in a skillet and place it on the grill, break it apart and fry it up so that it
              is nice and crispy!
          </li>
          <li><strong>THE FINAL STEP</strong>, throw that meat on a tilla' with some cheese of your choice,
          sals aka salsa, and all the other fixins. Eat it. Enjoy. You deserve it you King or/and Queen.</li>
